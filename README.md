SimpleNotetaking
================

Hi! Finally got the ball rolling on this thing. 

I have just initialized a basic project in eclipse without any changes as of now.
Please add things to do here.
ToDo:
-Umm everything.



To pull the project files:

$ git clone https://github.com/LetsHangout/SimpleNotetaking


To pull any changes:

$ git pull origin master


To push changes:

$ git add [file that was changed]

$ git commit -m ['message']

$ git push origin [branch]
